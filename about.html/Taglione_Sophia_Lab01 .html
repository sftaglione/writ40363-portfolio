     <p> I am a Junior at Texas Christian University, majoring in Strategic Communication and a minor in Digital Culture and Data Analytics. Through my academic journey, I have developed a strong interest in the intersection of media, technology, and communication. My coursework has introduced me to the foundations of public relations, advertising, and digital culture, while also giving me practical skills in content creation, campaign design, and digital storytelling. These studies have allowed me to see how creativity and strategy come together in the world of communication. </p>

  <h3>My background</h3>
  </header>

  <p>I come from a very Italian family of six with three sisters, which definitely keeps life fun and lively. We also have two dogs who are a big part of the family. Growing up, my home life has always been filled with energy, laughter, and strong family bonds, which has shaped me into the person I am today. Also, outside of school, I have always loved being outdoors. My family has a huge ranch, and spending time there has been one of the best parts of my childhood.</p>

      <p>One day I hope to own my own boutique or makeup brand. I have 2+ years of experience in social media strategy and brand management, including internships where I built content, managed campaigns, and developed creative strategies for boutiques and lifestyle brands. I am passionate about advertising, influencer marketing, and helping brands connect authentically with their audiences.</p>

    <p> This connects to my minor in Digital Culture & Data Analytics because so much of today’s communication and branding is driven by data and digital tools. Understanding how audiences engage with content online, interpreting analytics, and adapting strategies based on those insights are key skills in PR and advertising. By studying DCDA, I’m learning how to bridge creativity with data to design campaigns that are not only eye-catching but also effective.</p>

          <p>In this course, I am learning the foundations of digital coding and how technology shapes the way we share and analyze information. I’ve been building basic web pages using HTML and practicing how to organize content through sections, images, and text. It’s been helpful to see how coding connects to communication, since so much of today’s professional work relies on digital platforms. This class is giving me both creative and technical skills that I can carry into future projects in PR, advertising, and digital media.</p>

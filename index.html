            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Sophia Taglione. I am a Junior at TCU studying Strategic Communication at TCU with a minor in Digital Culture and Data Analytics. I come from a very Italian family of six with three sisters, which definetly keeps life fun and livel. We also have two dogs who are a big part of the family. Growing up, my home life has always been filled with energy, laughter, and strong family bonds, which has shaped me into the person I am today. My family also has a big ranch, and spending time out there has been one of the best parts of my childhood.</p>
            <p>In this course, I am learning the foundations of coding and how technology shapes communication. It is super exciting to see how digital skills connect to creativity and strategy in PR and advertising. One of my long term goals is to own my own botique or makeup brand. I want to use my communication and digital media skills to build strong, authentic connections between brands and people. I love fashion, traveling, and spending time with my family and friends. Riding horses on our ranch is one of my favorite hobbies.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Sophia Taglione, and I am a Junior at TCU majoring in Strategic Communication with a minor in Digital Culture and Data Analytics. I come from a very Italian family of six, with three sisters who definitely keep life fun and lively. We also have two dogs who are a big part of the family as well. Growing up, my home was always filled with energy, laughter, and a very strong family bond that led to many experiences that have shaped me into the person I am today. My family also has a ranch, and spending time there has been one of the best parts of my childhood.</p>
            <p>In this course, I am learning the foundations of coding and exploring how technology shapes communication. It has been exciting to see how digital skills connect to creativity and strategy in PR and advertising. One of my long term goals is to own my own boutique or makeup brand, where I can use my communication and digital media skills to build strong, authentic connections between brands and people. Outside of academics, I love fashion, traveling, and spending time with family and friends and riding horses at our ranch remains one of my favorite hobbies.</p>

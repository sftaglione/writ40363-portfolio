        <div class="about-text">
            <p>Hi, my name is Sophia Taglione, and I am a Junior at Texas Christian University. I’m majoring in Strategic Communication and minoring in Digital Culture and Data Analytics. I chose this path because I’ve always been interested in how people connect with each other, and I love exploring the role media and technology play in communication today. At TCU, I’ve been able to combine my creativity with strategy, which has helped me grow both academically and personally. I come from a big Italian family of six, with three sisters who keep life exciting and fun. Growing up in such a lively household taught me the importance of teamwork, patience, and finding joy in everyday moments. My family also has a ranch, and spending time there riding horses or helping out with ranch work has given me a strong appreciation for hard work and responsibility. Those experiences have shaped me into the person I am now driven, energetic, and always ready to take on new challenges.</p>
            <p>Outside of school, I’m very involved in my sorority, Delta Gamma, where I’ve had leadership roles like Social Media Chair and Panhellenic Delegate. Being active on campus has allowed me to build friendships, gain leadership experience, and balance my academic life with my social life. I also enjoy traveling, fashion, and finding new creative outlets whether it’s through social media, design projects, or event planning. Looking ahead, I hope to use what I’m learning at TCU to build a career in advertising, PR, or digital media. My goal is to help brands connect with people in authentic ways while staying creative and culturally aware. I’m excited to keep learning, growing, and finding opportunities that let me combine my passions with my career goals.</p>

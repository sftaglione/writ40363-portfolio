Project Description:
IDK You Pick is an interactive, browser-based decision-making tool that lets users add custom options, spin a dynamic wheel, and get a random choice. The app stores options and past picks using localStorage, visualizes category stats through a bar chart, and includes a fully animated spinning wheel built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created for WRIT 40363 – Project Zed, focusing on upskilling JavaScript logic, UI design, state management, and AI-assisted development.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox, CSS variables, animations, responsive design), JavaScript (DOM manipulation, event delegation, localStorage)
Libraries: Chart.js for data visualization

AI Tools: 
ChatGPT — debugging, refactoring, explanations, problem-solving and GitHub Copilot — in-editor autocomplete and small code suggestions

Setup Instructions:
To run the project locally: Download or clone the repository, Open the project folder, Double-click index.html to open it in a browser, Add options → click “Pick For Me 🎉” → watch the wheel spin, View history and stats as you make decisions

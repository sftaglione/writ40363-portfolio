What did you build and why?**
For my Project 4 ZED web app, I built an interactive “IDK U Pick” decision-maker tool because honestly, I wanted something that felt both fun and useful—something I would actually use in my everyday life. I’m indecisive about everything (food, plans, chores, literally anything), so creating a tool that helps me make choices in a cute, animated, custom way felt perfect. Instead of copying something simple like a random picker, I challenged myself to build a whole interactive experience: a form to add options, a categorized data structure, a spin wheel animation, a history tracker, and even a stats chart that updates automatically. I basically wanted it to feel like a tiny real app, not just an assignment.

What skills from Projects 1-3 did you upskill? How?**
I genuinely feel like Project 4 forced me to use everything I learned earlier, but on “hard mode.” From Project 1, I used my HTML/CSS structure skills to build clean, semantic sections and style the whole page in a cohesive, branded way. I didn’t just style things to “look good.” I actually thought about spacing, alignment, color pairing, and how each part of the interface should flow. Compared to my first project, the polish is so much stronger. From Project 2, I carried over all the JavaScript fundamentals, query selectors, functions, data manipulation, arrays, click events, etc. But this time I used them with way more intention. For example, storing options and history using objects pushed me to understand structured data way better. Also, rewriting parts of the project on my own helped me break the habit of copying patterns and instead trust my ability to create them. From Project 3, the biggest upskill was working with external code libraries (Chart.js) and handling complex DOM updates. I learned how to generate charts dynamically, destroy old ones, recreate new ones, and sync them with state. Also, this project required way more debugging, especially with the wheel rotation math—so I leveled up on using console logs, testing edge cases, and learning how to break a problem down until it finally worked. Overall, Project 4 is the most “real-developer” project I’ve done. It combines interactive UI, animations, data storage, dynamic visuals, and messy user input—all skills I didn’t have a few months ago.

How did AI change your development process?**
AI honestly became like a collaborative coding partner. I didn’t ask it to “do the whole project,” but instead I used it to help me unblock myself faster. If something wasn’t working (like the wheel labels or slice rotation math), AI helped explain why and gave alternatives I could test. It saved me so much time Googling random StackOverflow posts that may or may not apply to my code. It also helped me understand the why, not just the what. Whenever AI suggested something, I rewrote parts of it myself and made sure I actually got what was happening. Instead of guessing or trial-and-error forever, it narrowed me toward the right logic so I could finish in a realistic amount of time.

What surprised you about working with AI?**
What surprised me most was how good AI is at translating broad ideas into real, working code—but only if I communicate clearly. If I wrote a vague question, the answer wasn’t useful. But when I explained the bug step-by-step, AI gave extremely specific solutions, almost like a peer tutor who actually knows what I mean. I was also surprised by how creative AI can be. The spin wheel animation, the alternating colors, the label rotation corrections, and even the chart summary ideas all came from brainstorming with AI. It didn’t just fix errors, it helped me think bigger.

What would you do differently next time?**
Next time, I would start earlier on the more complex feature—like the wheel animation—because that’s where I spent the most time debugging. I’d also sketch my UI before coding, instead of designing it as I go. And I want to challenge myself to write more of the logic first before asking AI for help, so I can check how far I can go alone.

How has your confidence as a developer changed?**
Honestly, it skyrocketed. Before this class, I couldn’t write a single JavaScript function. Now I built a full mini-app with animations, charts, event listeners, objects, storage, and a custom UI. I actually feel like I can open VS Code and make whatever I want, not just beginners’ examples. Using AI also boosted my confidence because it showed me that coding isn’t about knowing everything—it’s about knowing how to problem-solve, ask good questions, experiment, and not give up when something breaks. I went from scared of code to proud of the project I built—and excited to build more.

Week #2 Reflection and Self-Assessment by Sophia Taglione WRIT40363

**1. Confidence Check**  
I do not feel that confident with HTML after two weeks. I’m solid on structure and headings, but I still think carefully about semantics and when to split content into sections.

**2. Learning Curve**  
Learning Git and GitHub was a little confusing at first, especially figuring out the steps of add, commit, and push. What surprised me most was how version control lets you go back to earlier versions and track every change, which makes collaboration so much easier. It ended up being less difficult than I expected once I practiced, and I actually found using GitHub online pretty straightforward.

**3. Problem-Solving Growth**  
When code didn’t look right, I validated with W3Schools double checking all my work, but most importantly checking my tag nesting. I also compared against working examples and fixed invalid header/nav nesting.

**4. Professional Mindset**  
I’m moving from “just make a page” to communicating clearly with semantic HTML and version control. I’m excited that these habits mirror real team workflows.

**5. Week 2 Reflection**  
My biggest “aha moment” this week was realizing how much cleaner my pages became once I used semantic HTML with proper <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>. It finally "clicked" that these tags aren’t just for looks—they give structure that helps accessibility, SEO, and teamwork. Once I saw my site validate correctly at W3C, the value of doing it right made sense.

**6. Looking Forward**  
I’m curious about responsive layouts and basic CSS to make this portfolio cleaner while keeping accessibility strong.

**7. Support & Resources**  
Hands-on practice and the validator were most helpful. Going forward, I might need quick checks from classmates or office hours on repo organization.
